    "description": "<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that was created through a hard fork of the <a href=\"/crypto/bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain in August of 2017. Each holder of BTC could access the equivalent amount of BCH after the fork was completed.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the reason for the fork was that the Bitcoin community split in two camps who had very different ideas on how to ensure that the Bitcoin network is sufficiently scalable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest difference is that Bitcoin Cash has a much higher block size limit &ndash; the argument surrounding Bitcoin&rsquo;s block size limit was one of the most contentious points in the debate that led to the 2017 hard fork.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Key Bitcoin Cash features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in 2017</li>\n\t<li>Differs from Bitcoin by using a different approach to scaling</li>\n\t<li>Uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The maximum block size of a Bitcoin Cash block is 32 megabytes, while the maximum block size of a Bitcoin block is one megabyte. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s increased block size allows it to handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin, but the higher block size limit comes with its own downsides as well &ndash; for example, it is more expensive to operate a full node.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many proponents of Bitcoin Cash say that the cryptocurrency is fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s original idea of a peer-to-peer electronic cash. In general, the medium of exchange function of cryptocurrency is emphasized more strongly by the Bitcoin Cash community compared to the Bitcoin community.</p>\n\n<p>While Bitcoin Cash is considerably smaller than Bitcoin, the coin has successfully established itself as one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BCH is listed by virtually all major cryptocurrency exchanges and is supported by several cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin Cash itself went through a contentious hard fork in 2018, resulting in the creation of <a href=\"/crypto/bitcoin-sv/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin SV</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Bitcoin Cash price, market cap and news.</p>\n",
