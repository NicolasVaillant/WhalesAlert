    "description": "<p>UNI is the governance token of <a href=\"/exchange/uniswapv3/\" target=\"_blank\">Uniswap</a>, which is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges on the market. Uniswap popularized the AMM (automatic market maker) model, which is now used by the majority of popular decentralized exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>Uniswap first launched in 2018, but didn&rsquo;t have its own token until September 2020. The Uniswap project decided to launch the UNI governance token after Uniswap forks like <a href=\"/exchange/sushiswap/\" target=\"_blank\">SushiSwap</a> attempted to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; users and liquidity from Uniswap by launching their own tokens and distributing them to users as an incentive.</p>\n\n<p>UNI tokens were distributed through an innovative mechanism that&rsquo;s now commonly referred to as a &ldquo;retroactive airdrop&rdquo;. Instead of selling tokens or airdropping them &nbsp;randomly, Uniswap decided to distribute tokens to addresses that interacted with the protocol prior to the airdrop. Later on, other <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/cryptocurrencies/sector/defi/\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi projects</a> like <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/dydx-token/\" target=\"_blank\">dYdX</a> and <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/1inch/\" target=\"_blank\">1inch</a> distributed their tokens through a similar model.</p>\n\n<p>Before we take a closer look at UNI, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of its most important features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The governance token for the Uniswap protocol</li>\n\t<li>UNI holders can vote on key decisions and parameters related to Uniswap</li>\n\t<li>Voters can also allocate UNI tokens that are held by the Uniswap treasury</li>\n\t<li>Issued on the Ethereum blockchain as an <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/cryptocurrencies/sector/ethereum-erc20/\" target=\"_blank\">ERC-20 token</a></li>\n\t<li>15% of the UNI supply was distributed through an airdrop for past users</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What is Uniswap (UNI) and how does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that was first launched in 2018. Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams, who received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation to develop the protocol. Through Uniswap&rsquo;s smart contracts, users can exchange between different tokens in an automated and trustless manner. Unlike centralized exchanges, which decide which tokens they will list on their platforms, anyone can list any token on Uniswap. Originally launched on the <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> network, the Uniswap is now also available on other blockchain platforms, for example <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/matic-network/\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon</a> and <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/optimism/\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, Uniswap is largely responsible for popularizing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) design, which is now the standard among decentralized exchanges. AMMs are unique when compared to other types of exchanges primarily because they don&rsquo;t have an order book.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, anyone can act as an LP (liquidity provider) and deposit tokens into liquidity pools. On Uniswap, cryptocurrency traders tap into these liquidity pools to perform token swaps and LPs collect a fee on each trade.</p>\n\n<p>The main idea behind AMMs is that the total value of both types of tokens held by a liquidity pool remains equal, which is how the price or exchange rate between two tokens is determined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the UNI token is to enable the Uniswap protocol to be owned and governed as a public good, instead of being a project that&rsquo;s advanced by a small group of developers. UNI token holders control Uniswap&rsquo;s governance process, the UNI community treasury, the protocol fee switch, and some of the other assets related to the protocol, for example the uniswap.eth ENS name.</p>\n\n<h3>Uniswap price history</h3>\n\n<p>The Uniswap crypto exchange is immensely popular among traders, with its trading volume often rivaling that of major centralized exchanges. For this reason, it&rsquo;s not too surprising that the UNI crypto token has established itself as one of the most valuable tokens in the DeFi sector. However, if we check out the UNI price chart, we can see that the price of UNI has seen big fluctuations since the token was launched in September 2020. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of the key UNI price milestones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>$5 - The UNI coin price reached $5 for the first time ever on September 19, 2020</li>\n\t<li>$10 - The Uniswap crypto price hit the $10 milestone for the first time on January 25, 2021</li>\n\t<li>$15 - The price of UNI hit $15 for the first time on January 30, 2021</li>\n\t<li>$20 - The first time that the UNI price achieved $20 was on February 2, 2022</li>\n\t<li>$30 - The UNI value surpassed $30 for the first time on March 8, 2021</li>\n\t<li>$40 - The UNI price reached $40 for the first time ever on April 29, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Uniswap market cap reached as high as $22 billion in May of 2021. In the same month, the protocol&rsquo;s TVL (total value locked) surpassed $10 billion for the first time.

The initial supply of UNI is 1 billion tokens, but the supply will begin inflating at a rate of 2% per year that will kick in 4 years after the token&rsquo;s launch.</p>\n\n<p>The inflation is meant to incentivize active participation in Uniswap governance and disincentivize passive UNI holding. Through the inflation mechanism, the proportion of the total UNI supply distributed to community members will gradually increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Here is how the initial Uniswap supply was allocated:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Community members (protocol users and liquidity providers): 60%</li>\n\t<li>Team members and employees (4-year vesting): 21.26%</li>\n\t<li>Investors (4-year vesting): 18%</li>\n\t<li>Advisors (4-year vesting): 0.69%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The most important Uniswap milestones</h3>\n\n<p>Uniswap is arguably the leading project in the decentralized finance space, and it has achieved many significant milestones since its inception in 2018. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of the most notable achievements by the project:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>November 2018 - Uniswap launches on the Ethereum mainnet</li>\n\t<li>May 2020 - Uniswap launches the v2 version of its protocol</li>\n\t<li>September 2020 - The TVL of Uniswap surpasses &nbsp;$1 billion</li>\n\t<li>September 2020 - Uniswap launches the UNI token</li>\n\t<li>May 2021 - Uniswap v3 launches on the Ethereum mainnet</li>\n\t<li>May 2021 - The TVL of Uniswap surpasses $10 billion&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>July 2021 - Uniswap launches on the Optimism layer 2</li>\n\t<li>June 2022 - Uniswap Labs acquires Genie, an NFT marketplace aggregator&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n",
