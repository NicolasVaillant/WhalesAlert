    "description": "<p>Avalanche is one of the fastest growing blockchain networks for smart contracts and decentralized applications. The platform, which can serve as an alternative to <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a>, has gained the confidence of many blockchain developers. It prides itself as a fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly smart contract platform.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that it is also compatible with Solidity (Ethereum&rsquo;s programming language) makes it even more appealing to developers and enterprise users, many of whom are accustomed to the tools offered by the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Before going further, here&rsquo;s a quick summary of Avalanche&rsquo;s key features: &nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The origin of Avalanche is traced to a team that goes by the name &ldquo;Team Rocket&rdquo; but the project was developed by a group of researchers from Cornell University</li>\n\t<li>The Avalanche mainnet was launched in September 2020 and it has already secured over 100 individual projects</li>\n\t<li>Avalanche supports three primary built-in blockchains, including the exchange chain (X-Chain), platform chain (P-Chain), and contract chain (C-Chain)</li>\n\t<li>Avalanche allows developers to deploy customizable public or private blockchains that meet their needs</li>\n\t<li>Avalanche is currently home to a variety of projects in different sub-niches, including DeFi (decentralized finance) applications and popular games</li>\n\t<li>AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, is a digital asset that is available across top cryptocurrency exchanges and related platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can find the up-to-date AVAX price chart, trading pairs, <a href=\"/crypto/avalanche/historical-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Avalanche historical prices</a> and more on CoinCodex.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Avalanche and how does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanche can basically be described as a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. According to its official website, Avalanche is an &ldquo;open, programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications&rdquo;. The website also claims that &ldquo;Avalanche is the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Like every other smart contract platform, Avalanche is primarily used for launching decentralized applications, which serve different purposes. It is a notable blockchain in the <a href=\"/cryptocurrencies/sector/defi/\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi</a> space, and it is also used to create apps in the gaming niche.</p>\n\n<p>Like most public blockchain networks, Avalanche has a native currency&mdash; AVAX. This is the digital asset that powers the network and determines individuals&rsquo; stake in the Avalanche ecosystem. AVAX is used for settling transaction fees and can also be staked to secure the network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it is important to reiterate that the Avalanche network is made up of three component chains. The functions of these chains are as follow:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Exchange Chain (X-Chain) &ndash; which is used to send and receive funds on the network</li>\n\t<li>Platform Chain (P-Chain) &ndash; which is used for Avalanche staking and facilitating validator activities</li>\n\t<li>Contract Chain (C-Chain) &ndash; which is used for the creation of smart contracts and DeFi apps</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The descriptions of the different chains in Avalanche summarize how the entire network works. The native token of the network, AVAX, is another important component to keep in mind. By serving as the asset that secures the network, AVAX enables fast peer-to-peer transactions, decentralized computation and storage, as well as the creation of new subnets (blockchains). &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Avalanche Price History</h3>\n\n<p>The prices of digital assets fluctuate from time to time, and the Avalanche crypto price is not an exception to this rule. To understand the Avalanche price today, it is helpful to understand how it has changed over the years.<br />\nIt is important to state at this juncture that Avalanche price is influenced by a lot of factors, especially the general conditions in the crypto market. The activities within the Avalanche ecosystem can also have a significant effect on the price. The prices of other <a href=\"/news/category/top-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">top-ranked cryptocurrencies</a> like <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum can also influence the AVAX coin price.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are important milestones in Avalanche&#39;s price history:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>AVAX was launched through an ICO on July 15, 2020 and the ICO price was $0.5 per token</li>\n\t<li>The AVAX price grew significantly after the ICO and by September 22, 2020, the price was already $5.28 per token</li>\n\t<li>The price of AVAX recorded its post-ICO all-time low of $2.80 on December 31, 2020</li>\n\t<li>The AVAX crypto reached the $10 mark for the first time on January 16, 2021</li>\n\t<li>Avalanche reached the $50 mark for the first time on August 22, 2021</li>\n\t<li>The AVAX value reached the $100 mark on November 17, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just like the Avalanche coin price, the Avalanche market cap has also seen significant fluctuations. For example, the AVAX market cap was around $100 million in October 2020, but surpassed $10 billion as of September 2021.</p>\n\n<h3>Avalanche Supply</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanche has a cap on its supply, as the AVAX max supply is set at 720 million tokens. Avalanche has a detailed supply schedule for the Avalanche token (AVAX) that is expected to be distributed by 2030. Here is how the supply of AVAX is meant to be allocated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Airdrop &ndash; 2.5%</li>\n\t<li>Private Sale &ndash; 3.5%</li>\n\t<li>Strategic Partners &ndash; 5.0%</li>\n\t<li>Community and Developers &ndash; 7.0%</li>\n\t<li>Foundation &ndash; 9.3%</li>\n\t<li>Public Sale Option B &ndash; 0.7%</li>\n\t<li>Public Sale option A2 &ndash; 8.3%</li>\n\t<li>Team &ndash; 10.0%</li>\n\t<li>Staking Reward &ndash; 50.0%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously, the decision-makers at Avalanche reserved half of AVAX tokens for staking rewards. This underlines the importance of securing the network and rewarding AVAX holders who are ready to contribute to securing and growing the network by <a href=\"https://www.avax.network/validators\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AVAX staking</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>The most important Avalanche milestones</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanche has seen significant improvement from the time it was launched to date. There has been a lot in terms of upgrades, technical changes, and tokenomics.</p>\n\n<p>Here, we will highlight some of Avalanche&rsquo;s major milestones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>April 2020 &ndash; Avalanche launched its first public Testnet</li>\n\t<li>June 2020 &ndash; The Avalanche token was renamed to AVAX, and the company raised $12 million in Private Token Sale</li>\n\t<li>July 2020 &ndash; The Avalanche cryptocurrency was launched via an ICO that raised $45 million in just 4.5 hours</li>\n\t<li>September 2020 &ndash; The Avalanche mainnet was launched with all three component chains going live</li>\n\t<li>January 2021 &ndash; Avalanche integrates with Reef DeFi and the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge was also introduced</li>\n\t<li>May 2021 &ndash; <a href=\"/article/2354/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\">NFT</a> minting was enabled in the Avalanche network</li>\n\t<li>June 2021 &ndash; Avalanche released its roadmap</li>\n\t<li>June, July and September 2021 &ndash; Avalanche underwent a series of audits and improvements</li>\n\t<li>December 2021 &ndash; Avalanche added support for <a href=\"/cryptocurrencies/sector/stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a> to promote stablecoin diversity and stability of the network</li>\n\t<li>February 2022 &ndash; Avalanche (AVAX), being one of the fastest-growing digital assets, breaks into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Avalanche vs. Solana</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanche and <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/solana/\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> are similar blockchain projects. They both have smart contract functionality and primarily serve as launch platforms for <a href=\"/dapp-list/\" target=\"_blank\">DApps</a> (decentralized apps). They are also known for their scalability.<br />\nBoth Avalanche and Solana have grown considerably in the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>However, Avalanche seems to be ahead when you consider core metrics. Both offer low fees and high throughput. Avalanche, however, is considerably more stable than Solana. Solana&#39;s reputation is not as strong as that of Avalanche mostly because of the number of network outages it has suffered.</p>\n",
