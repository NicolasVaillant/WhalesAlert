    "description": "<p>Polkadot is a blockchain project that was founded in 2016 and launched its mainnet in 2020. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Wood, an English computer scientist that was also one of the founding members of the <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> project.</p>\n\n<p>The overarching idea behind Polkadot is interoperability&mdash;the platform is meant to enable different blockchains to communicate with each other, and perform operations like cross-chain token transfers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Polkadot network itself consists of the Relay Chain, which orchestrates the network&rsquo;s consensus through Nominated <a href=\"/article/7142/what-is-proof-of-stake/\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Stake</a>, and &ldquo;parachains&rdquo;&mdash;these are customizable blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain and benefit from its security. All of the parachains connected to Polkadot can interoperate with each other, and combine to form an ecosystem of blockchains.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick summary of some of Polkadot&rsquo;s most important features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Founded in 2016 and raised capital through multiple token sales, including an initial coin offering</li>\n\t<li>Mainnet launched in 2020</li>\n\t<li>Uses Nominated Proof-of-Stake</li>\n\t<li>Supports customized blockchains called &ldquo;parachains&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Projects can compete for parachain slots through auctions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What is Polkadot and how does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>Polkadot allows parachains, which are customizable blockchains built using the Substrate framework, to interoperate with each other. Developers can tailor the features of their parachain to their specific needs, while still inheriting the security of the Relay Chain, which is at the core of the Polkadot network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Users who hold DOT can use their tokens to nominate validators and earn rewards from the validators they&rsquo;re backing. Since operating a validator requires running a Polkadot node on a 24/7 basis, most everyday DOT holders will participate in the network as nominators. It&rsquo;s also possible to stake the DOT crypto through centralized crypto exchanges that offer Polkadot staking services.</p>\n\n<p>The number of parachains that Polkadot can support is limited, which is why projects that want to operate a parachain have to buy a parachain slot via <a href=\"/parachain-auctions/\" target=\"_blank\">parachain slot auctions</a>. To bid in these auctions, projects need to provide DOT, which is Polkadot&rsquo;s native asset. Through a mechanism called &ldquo;crowdloans&rdquo;, parachain projects can <a href=\"/article/12963/how-to-participate-in-polkadot-parachain-auctions/\" target=\"_blank\">receive DOT loans from their supporters</a> to help them win a parachain slot auction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first parachain slot auctions on Polkadot happened in late 2021. The network has since onboarded more than a dozen parachains and the list is steadily growing over time. Parachain projects are tackling a number of use cases, here are some of the examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/acala/\" target=\"_blank\">Acala</a> - A hub for <a href=\"/cryptocurrencies/sector/defi/\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized finance</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/moonbeam/\" target=\"_blank\">Moonbeam</a> - EVM-compatible smart contracts platform</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/efinity/\" target=\"_blank\">Efinity</a> - A parachain specialized for non-fungible tokens</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/centrifuge/\" target=\"_blank\">Centrifuge</a> - Tokenizing real-world assets on the blockchain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When talking about Polkadot, it&rsquo;s also important to mention the Web3 Foundation, a Switzerland-based organization that provides grants to projects building on Polkadot and also publishes research related to blockchains, cryptography and Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Substrate framework, which is used by Polkadot was developed by Parity, a software development company that&rsquo;s also one of the main drivers of the technical development of Polkadot.</p>\n\n<h3>Polkadot price history</h3>\n\n<p>Most cryptocurrency prices see major fluctuations as the market goes through its bullish and bearish cycles, and DOT is no exception. DOT is one of the largest crypto assets in terms of market capitalization, and is available on almost all of the biggest <a href=\"/exchanges/\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> where it can be exchanged for other digital assets or fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s quickly go through the DOT price chart some of the biggest milestones for the DOT price since the token began trading on exchanges.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>$5 - The price of DOT exceeded $5 for the first time ever in September 2020</li>\n\t<li>$10 - DOT first reached the $10 mark in January 2021</li>\n\t<li>$20 - The first time that DOT reached a price of $20 was in February 2021</li>\n\t<li>$30 - The DOT coin price first reached $30 in February 2021</li>\n\t<li>$40 - The first time that DOT reached $40 was in February 2021</li>\n\t<li>$50 - The Polkadot crypto price first exceeded $50 in November 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Polkadot market cap has of course also seen major fluctuations. For example, the DOT market cap was at $3.5 billion in September of 2020 and increased all the way to $53 billion in November 2021.</p>\n\n<h3>Polkadot supply</h3>\n\n<p>A notable aspect of Polkadot is that the supply of DOT is not capped, which means that there is no DOT max supply. The total supply of DOT inflates over time, at a rate of about 10% per year. This means that DOT holders are incentivized to stake their coins and contribute to the security of the network, to avoid the value of their DOT holdings being diluted.</p>\n\n<p>As of June 2022, the supply of DOT was just under 1 billion coins, but this number will increase over time.</p>\n\n<p>One DOT consists of 10 billion &ldquo;Plancks&rdquo;. This is the smallest possible denomination of DOT, similar to how 100 million &ldquo;satoshis&rdquo; make up <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\">1 BTC</a>. The DOT token went through a redenomination process in August of 2020. The redenomination defined 1 DOT as consisting of 10 billion &ldquo;Plancks&rdquo;. When comparing the Polkadot price today to prices during the Polkadot token sale, it&rsquo;s important to take the redenomination into account.</p>\n\n<h3>The most important Polkadot milestones</h3>\n\n<p>The Polkadot project has seen some significant developments since it was founded in 2016. Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the biggest milestones that Polkadot has achieved so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>October 2017 - The <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/ico/polkadot/\" target=\"_blank\">Polkadot ICO</a> raises $145 million</li>\n\t<li>June 2019 - Polkadot raises undisclosed amount through private token sale</li>\n\t<li>May 2020 - The Relay Chain begins operating</li>\n\t<li>July 2020 - Polkadot raises $43.3 million through a private token sale</li>\n\t<li>August 2020 - DOT is redenominated after community vote</li>\n\t<li>December 2021 - The first parachains are added to the Polkadot network</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Polkadot vs. Kusama</h3>\n\n<p>If you have been reading up on the Polkadot cryptocurrency, you have most likely also heard of <a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/kusama/\" target=\"_blank\">Kusama</a>, which is sometimes referred to as Polkadot&rsquo;s &ldquo;canary network&rdquo;. Kusama is a platform that&rsquo;s very similar to Polkadot from a technical perspective, but has looser governance parameters that allow for new features to be adopted more quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Typically, experimental features are first added to Kusama and make their way to Polkadot later if they work as intended. However, this does not mean that Kusama is a testnet. KSM is an asset with real value and there are a number of interesting projects building on the platform. In fact, many of the projects that have launched Polkadot parachains have also built parachains on the Kusama network.</p>\n",
